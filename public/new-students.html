<div class="section">Get in Touch</div>
<p>If you're interested in lessons, please read over the information below then <a href="contact.html">send me a message</a>. Let me know what you're interested in and tell me about your background in music, if any.</p>

<div class="section">Beginning Students</div>

<p>Do you need a conservatory-trained teacher if you're a just a beginner? That's up to you! I will say that I specialize in building strong technical and practice foundations right from the start, something not all teachers can offer. I've also developed a systematic way of encorporating music theory into lessons, either in examining current repertoire, or as exercises played at the keyboard.</p>

<div class="section">Trial Lessons</div>
<p>You can try one lesson first for $30. This will give you an idea of what lessons will be like. I can provide advice on getting an instrument if you don't have one already.</p>

<div class="section">General Requirements</div>
<p>You will need to practice daily.</p>

<div class="section">Piano Student Requirements</div>
<p>You will need to have a keyboard with fully weighted keys or an acoustic piano at home, or have regular access to one.</p>

<div class="section">Guitar Student Requirements</div>
<p><em>I only take beginning guitar students.</em></p>
<p>You will need an acoustic guitar, with a case so you can bring it to lessons, and a music stand. I highly recommend a classical guitar to start even if you're interested in popular styles: a classical guitar's nylon strings are much easier on beginners' fingers.</p>
