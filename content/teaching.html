<p>I teach piano, composition, music theory, and improvisation to adult students on Chauncy Street in Cambridge.</p>

<div class="section">New Students</div>
<p>See <a href="new-students.html">New Student Information</a>.</p>

<div class="section">Communication</div>
<p>For general communication and booking, please email me. For day of the lesson communication, like cancellations, please text.</p>

<div class="section">Booking Lessons</div>
<p>Confirm lesson time(s) in person or by email, then make a payment to book it.</p>
#if 0
<p>When booking a month of lessons, we'll schedule all lessons in advance. For convenience, we'll set a regular lesson time and day when possible.</p>
#endif
<p><em>Please be sure you'll be available at the time(s) you book, payments are non-refundable.</em></p>

<div class="section">Rescheduling</div>
<p>A reasonable amount of rescheduling is allowed, but is dependent on my availability. For illness, let me know as soon as possible. For all other reasons, please give 24 hours notice. Lessons cancelled with less than 24 hours notice are not eligable to be rescheduled.</p>

<div class="section">Arriving</div>
<p>Use the main entrance&mdash;through the arch, down the path. The intercom doesn't work, so text when you arrive. If the entrance is unlocked, you can come in and knock (loudly!) on my door at your lesson time even if you hear music or a lesson in progress.</p>

<div class="section">Payment</div>
<p>Please pay in advance with cash or <a href="images/pay.jpeg" alt="please contact for payment link">Venmo</a>. Your payment serves as a booking confirmation and holds the lesson time(s). A lower rate applies when paying for 4 or more lessons in a month.</p>

<div class="section">Rates</div>
<p>Piano lessons start at $240 per month. Guitar lessons start at $220 per month. Paying for individual lessons is also possible.</p>
